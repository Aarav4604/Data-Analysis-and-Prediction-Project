# Data-Analysis-and-Prediction-Project

Welcome to my Data Science Analysis Project repository! This project showcases my ability to analyze various datasets, design appropriate analyses, and draw meaningful conclusions. The project covers three distinct analyses: student performance, bike traffic in New York City, and data security in model training.

Project Overview

This repository contains my work on three different datasets, each providing unique challenges and requiring tailored analysis approaches. The goal is to demonstrate my data science skills by exploring the data, performing relevant analyses, and presenting the results.

**Paths**

Path 1: Student Performance Related to Video-Watching Behavior

This analysis focuses on understanding how students' video-watching behaviors relate to their performance in an online course.

- Dataset: behavior_performance.txt
- Analysis Objectives:
- Clustering: Group students by their video-watching behavior to identify patterns.
- Prediction: Predict a student's average quiz performance based on their video-watching behavior.
- In-Video Quiz Performance: Predict a student's performance on specific in-video quiz questions based on their behavior.
  
Path 2: Bike Traffic in New York City

This analysis examines bike traffic data across New York City's bridges to provide insights for city planning and policy-making.

- Dataset: nyc_bicycle_counts_2016.csv
- Analysis Objectives:
- Sensor Placement: Determine the best three bridges to install sensors on to predict overall bike traffic.
- Traffic Prediction: Use weather forecasts to predict the total number of bicyclists on a given day.
- Day Prediction: Predict the day of the week based on bike traffic patterns.

Path 3: Data Security in Model Training

This path focuses on ensuring data security during the training of machine learning models with image data.

- Dataset: Images of digits
- Analysis Objectives:
- Security Measures: Implement and evaluate security measures during model training.
- Model Robustness: Assess the robustness of models against potential security threats.
- Getting Started

**Prerequisites**
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

**Results and Discussion**

Path 1: Student Performance Related to Video-Watching Behavior
- Clustering: The clustering analysis revealed distinct groups of students based on their engagement with the videos. These clusters helped identify patterns of behavior associated with higher or lower performance.
- Prediction Models: Using regression models, I was able to predict students' average quiz scores with reasonable accuracy. The analysis highlighted key behaviors that correlate with better performance.
- In-Video Quiz Performance: By analyzing individual quiz questions, I developed models that predict the likelihood of a correct answer based on video-watching behavior, providing insights into specific learning behaviors.

Path 2: Bike Traffic in New York City
- Sensor Placement: Through regression analysis, I identified the optimal bridges for sensor placement, maximizing the accuracy of overall traffic predictions.
- Traffic Prediction: Using machine learning models, I demonstrated the feasibility of predicting daily bike traffic based on weather forecasts, aiding city planning efforts.
- Day Prediction: The analysis successfully classified the day of the week based on traffic patterns, revealing consistent usage trends.

Path 3: Data Security in Model Training
- Security Measures: I implemented various security protocols during model training to protect against data breaches and model inversion attacks.
- Model Robustness: The robustness assessment showed how different security measures impact model performance and resilience against threats.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates my ability to apply data science techniques to diverse datasets, design effective analyses, and draw meaningful conclusions. The insights gained from these analyses can inform decision-making and highlight the importance of thoughtful data exploration.
